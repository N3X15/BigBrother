# BigBrother PHP API
:author: N3X15 <nexis@7chan.org>

This is my half-assed PHP5 API for BigBrother, made for bbStats prior to my becoming a member of the BB team.  Thus, it's currently very broken and not generic enough for most web applications' consumption.  I will work on this (gradually) to improve it, in between managing a popular website, dealing with server dreama, and higher-priority BigBrother stuff.

I will distribute my horrible Frankenstein of a bbStats installation seperately.
