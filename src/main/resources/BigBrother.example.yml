#BigBrother Configuration file# For build 461+## Edit and Rename to BigBrother.yml# <-- This is a comment, meaning BigBrother will ignore it.# It'll also theoretically ignore empty lines.# FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT USE TABS.  INDENTING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.## You can test if this file works at http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/#General BigBrother Settingsgeneral:    # Store a map of block owners (for fire, lava, and water, used for tracking flowing block ownership)    store-owners: true        # IDs of ignored block types (1 for stone, etc.)    excluded-blocks: []        # Not used.      rollbacks-per-tick: 2000        # Log stuff about each person in an individual file?    personal-log-files: false        #Automatically start watching people as they join the server?    auto-watch: true        # Spam developer-targeted debugging information to console.    debug-mode: false        # Default radius for /bb here.    default-search-radius: 5        # TBD    tnt-threshold: 10.0        # Rollback fire    restore-fire: false        # Item ID of the SuperStick.  280 = stick    stick-item: 280        # Automatically download database libraries?    library-autodownload: true    # Database settingsdatabase:    # Type of database.
